A collection of utility/helper (BASH) scripts and related files I wrote to make life at the command prompt a little faster, easier and more intuitive. Good for any (Debian-based) unless you spend ALL your time in the GUI. Below is a complete index of every script/config in the repository - auto-updated every time a script is added. Short descriptions are populated from each script's header (the first few commented lines in the script) when available.

## init

This repository includes a short init script that is intended to be run immediately after cloning. It activates all the goodies, performing the following actions:

1. Rename the current directory from "bash-scripts" to "scripts" (if the cwd is named "bash-scripts").
2. Ensure $HOME/scripts is added to PATH by updating ~/.bashrc.
3. Copy the repository's .aliases to $HOME/.aliases.
4. Appends to .bashrc - `source .aliases` and adds $HOME/scripts to PATH (existing ~/.bashrc will be backed up) so that all aliases and scripts are activated and ready to use.
5. Lists all loaded aliases.
6. Prompt the user (read -n 1) whether to run fixnano (configures nano to enable mouse support and common key bindings - e.g. Ctrl+X = cut; Ctrl+V = Paste; Ctrl+S = Save, Ctrl+F = Find, etc.).

Usage (after cloning):

chmod +x init && ./init

## Scripts & (supporting) files
This table lists top-level files in the repository. Descriptions are taken from the first commented line of each file when present. To regenerate this table automatically, run the provided update-readme.sh generator which extracts first-line headers from scripts.
