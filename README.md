A collection of utility/helper (BASH) scripts and related files I wrote to make life at the command prompt a little faster, easier and more intuitive. Good for any (Debian-based) unless you spend ALL your time in the GUI. Below is a complete index of every script/config in the repository - auto-updated every time a script is added. Short descriptions are populated from each script's header (the first few commented lines in the script) when available.

## init

This repository includes a short init script that is intended to be run immediately after cloning. It activates all the goodies, performing the following actions:

1. Rename the current directory from "bash-scripts" to "scripts" (if the cwd is named "bash-scripts").
2. Ensure $HOME/scripts is added to PATH by updating ~/.bashrc.
3. Copy the repository's .aliases to $HOME/.aliases.
4. Appends to .bashrc - `source .aliases` and adds $HOME/scripts to PATH (existing ~/.bashrc will be backed up) so that all aliases and scripts are activated and ready to use.
5. Lists all loaded aliases.
6. Prompt the user whether to run fixnano (configures nano to enable mouse support and common key bindings - e.g. Ctrl+X = cut; Ctrl+V = Paste; Ctrl+S = Save, Ctrl+F = Find, etc.).

Usage (after cloning):

chmod +x init && ./init

## Scripts & (supporting) files
This table lists top-level files in the repository. Descriptions are taken from the first commented line of each file when present. To regenerate this table automatically, run the provided update-readme.sh generator which extracts first-line headers from scripts.
